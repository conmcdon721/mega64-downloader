This is a small program I wrote that downloads every archived audio
episode of Mega64 podcast from their archive website. At first, I didn't
use any asynchronous JavaScript, and only four or five files would fully
download before the connection timed out. This script became a really
useful exercise in asynchronous JavaScript. At least I'm telling myself
that because after a couple days' worth of work, I found out the website
actually provides a zip download of every episode, so I didn't even need
to write this script.
